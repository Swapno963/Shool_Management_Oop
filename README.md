# School Management System (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Introduction

The School Management System is an OOP application designed to manage and organize various aspects of a school, such as administrative information, teachers, classrooms, students, subjects, and academic assessments. This system is implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and extensibility.

## Key Features

### 1. School Creation

A school can be instantiated with its name and address, providing a fundamental structure for managing educational activities within the system.

### 2. Teacher and Classroom Management

Teachers and classrooms can be added to the school, allowing for efficient organization of the teaching and learning process.

### 3. Student Admission

Students can enroll in specific classrooms within the school, enabling administrators to track student records and academic progress.

### 4. Subject and Teacher Assignment

Subjects can be assigned to classrooms, and a dedicated teacher can be associated with each subject. This feature ensures that students receive proper instruction in various disciplines.

### 5. Semester Final Exams

The system facilitates the scheduling and management of semester final exams, allowing teachers to assess students' knowledge and progress in each subject.

### 6. Grading System

The grading system is designed to calculate students' scores in a realistic manner. Students receive random numbers between 0 and 100, and these scores are then converted into actual grades using a predefined grading scale. This approach ensures that student performance is accurately represented.

## Conclusion

The School Management System, developed using object-oriented programming, offers a versatile and efficient solution for school administrators and educators. It simplifies the management of schools, classrooms, teachers, and students while providing a realistic grading system to assess academic performance. This system helps streamline administrative tasks, improve educational quality, and enhance the overall educational experience within the institution.
